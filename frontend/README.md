# Three column

First one is users :-
showing all users herw as rendering Users Components
second is on chat area
As soon as the user click any of the Users components
the reciever id changes and when anothe ris clicked then also reciever id changes
This thsisng is done only for sending to the user nad not for showing notification to the user about other chats which is not selected

Sending and recieving is done with minor bugs

1. after clciking on input , then only state change

## recieving othe r chatsa and showing them as batches in the backgound

When the user is not selected any person then we need tomlisten to the socket recieved and then show to the particaular user name with badges and if the user clicked then fetching the chats

### TODOs

showing user online and offline
as soon as the user start typing showing the user is typing
making UI great
instaed of Storing on loacl storage Storing on redux like thing
not sending all data of user or sender
when user directly visits to chat then need to sigin or sigup or start chat or handling errors
